# 📦 PacketLab — A 3D OSI Model Visualizer

The OSI model often feels abstract when it’s only shown in textbooks or static diagrams — it’s almost always presented as a flat model.

**PacketLab** is a small 3D visual experiment designed to make the OSI model easier to understand.  
Each layer is represented as a protective **box** added around a central “data core,” similar to how packaging works in logistics.

The goal is simple:  
👉 **turn theory into something learners can actually *see*.**

## 🎯 Purpose

PacketLab aims to bridge the gap between:

- abstract networking theory  
- real, visual, intuitive understanding  

It is meant for:

- students  
- beginners in networking  
- teachers and trainers  
- anyone who learns better visually than through static diagrams

**Visualising the invisible helps transform complexity into intuition.**

## 🧠 Core Concept

PacketLab is built around a simple analogy inspired by logistics:

- 📦 **Each OSI layer = one box**
- 🏷️ **Each box adds an address or identifier** (MAC → IP → Port…)
- 🔄 **Encapsulation = packaging steps**, one layer at a time
- 💎 **The Data Core** is the central item being wrapped and protected

This allows learners to follow encapsulation like the preparation of a parcel moving through different processing stages.
